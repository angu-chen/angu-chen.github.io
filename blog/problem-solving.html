        A blog to talk about encountering problems through sprint 4 and how I
        combatted them.

      <h2>A time where I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>

      <p>
        So after all the human skills I was gearing up to do some coding. You
        know what I mean. Ready for some technical challenge, get the brain
        spinning. However as soon as I start trying to run the "npm" tets on teh
        manipulating-objects file I got an error saying "Cannot find module"
      </p>

      <img src="../images/npm-error.png" />
      <p>
        Great... I tried everything, I google it, try to update npm and even
        deleting the specific json files in the depository and re-running npm
        install. It all didn't work... until I sent a message on discord and a
        administrator helped. He made me feel less stupid because he said the
        problem was weird. In the end the fix was to recheckout the npm files
        and <span class="bold-style">BOOM</span> done. I learnt it was okay to
        ask for help.
      </p>

      <h2>A time I elegantly solved a porblem</h2>
      <p>
        The problem was kata "whereAreYou". In this kata you had to find Scooby
        in an array of objects. I solved it by creating a function and then just
        calling that function with the recommended .find method.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used console.log() to understand what the array looked like and how it
        was constructed. Then I manually found where "Scooby" was. He was held
        in the "Hiding" key. So I just made a small function that used an
        operator to see if the hiding key of an object was exactly equal to
        Scooby.
