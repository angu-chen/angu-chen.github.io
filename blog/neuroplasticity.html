      <h1>Chat about Neuroplaticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
      <p>
        In this blog post, we will have a chat about Neurosplasticity and the
        growth mindset.
      </p>
      <h2>Neuroplaticity</h2>
      <p>
        Neurosplasticity is the brains ability to grow, change and adapt
        throughout a persons life. Extrapolated, this means that humans have the
        ability to improve their skills and recover from trauma in an
        understandable way. This is very powerful as it gives individuals the
        ability to transform their own life.

        “Neurons that are used frequently develop stronger connections. Those
        that are rarely or never used eventually die. By developing new
        connections and pruning away weak ones, the brain can adapt to the
        changing environment.” -

        One of the key principles of neuroplasticity is when a neuron pathway is
        fire, the pathway becomes the insulation(myelin sheath) grows thicker.
        This in turn improves the ease of the neuron pathway to fire. In laymen
        terms, it is about the frequency of practice vs the cramming of practice
        that will improve your brains ability to develop.

        Another great idea is that the skills you have now are not always going
        to be the only set of skills you will ever have. A neuroplastic brain
        means anyone is capable of learning new skills and improve on the said
        skills. Lastly you can make use of the physiology of the brain in order
        to enhance the speed in which you learn. An example is to exercise
        regularly. Regular aerobic exercise creates more blood flow into the
        brain and enhances the availability of Brain Derived Neurotropic Factors
        (BDNF) which are involved in cognitive functions.

      <p>
        Another example is the practice of mindfulness and how meditation can
        increase cortical thickness in areas related to attention and sensory
        processing.
      </p>
      <h2>Are there ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, there definitely is. However they are not particularly “sexy” as
        one might think. It includes basic life admin and living a healthy life.
        Below is a list of areas which will effect the brains neuroplastic
        nature.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physcial Exercise</li>
        <li>Good sleep</li>
        <li>healthy diet</li>
        <li>learning new things</li>
        <li>consistently challenging yourself</li>
        <li>meditation and reflection</li>
      </ul>
