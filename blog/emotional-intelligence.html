      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EQ)is the ability to understand and process your
        own and others feelings and actions. There is five elements to EQ that
        form the core building blocks.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-style">Self-Awareness</span>- understanding your own
          emotions and the actions that come from them
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-style">Self-Regulation</span> - The ability to
          process, monitor and regulate your actions, emotions and thoughts
          depending on the situation
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-style">Motivation</span>- The ability to motivate
          yourself based on the idea of deferring short-term satisfaction for
          long-term sucess
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-style">Empathy</span>- The ability to understand how
          others are feeling and why they are feeling such emotions. It is also
          the ability to accept it even if you don't completely get it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-style">Social Skills</span>- The ability to build
          rapport and trust with others.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All of these elements are interrelated and therefore some of the skills
        are needed in one or more core building blocks. An example is in order
        to have great social skills and the ablity to generate rapport, it is
        important to be empathetic.
      </p>

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        EQ is unlike IQ because it is constantly developing and you have the
        ability to improve it. IQ is normally set. IQ is more concerned about
        your ability to solve problems while EQ is about how you interact and
        see yourself in the world.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p>
        EQ is important because it is essential to working well in teams, being
        a good leader and many other human-human interactions. Human- human
        interactions also extends to the metaphorical, i.e. you interacting with
        yourself.
