      <h1>Document Object Model (DOM)</h1>
      <p>
        The DOM is a data representation of the objects that make up the
        structure and content of a website. It is a programming interface
        allowing code to change the structure, style and content of said
        website. The DOM is constructed as a tree of objects with objects only
        ever having one parent. There is a core DOM API that defines the
        entities and then the capabilities are further expanded upon by other
        APIs.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/dom-glue.png" />
      <p>
        The DOM effectively acts as the glue that links Javascript, CSS and HTML
        together.
      </p>

      <h2>So... how does it all fit?</h2>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS and Javascript is like an experience at a restaruant. For this
        analogies sake, we have to pretend we are horrible people and an
        incredibly picky eater. You are at a restaruant and your food has just
        been served to you on a beautiful plate. The plate is the DOM. Here we
        have...
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">HTML</span>, the food, the basic ingredients
        that sit on your plate. For example, chicken, micro-greens etc
      </p>
      <img src="../images/code-meal-html.png" />

      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">CSS</span>, how the plate is presented, the
        flourish, the type of nutrients, the use of different colours and how
        they are placed together on plate.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/code-meal-css.html.png"
        alt="code representing some css in metaphor"
      />

      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">JavaScript</span>, where the magic happens, it
        is what the chef and waiters is doing in the restaruant.You want an
        extra steak medium raw? You want to replace the meat for a vegan
        friendly katsu panko fried tofu? No problem. JavaScript allows you to
        ask the chef to change your what’s on your plate. It can change what is
        on your plate (structure, HTML) or change the display so your meat
        doesn’t touch your peas (style, CSS)
      </p>

      <h2>So how does JavaScript work?</h2>
      <p>
        Lets look at the our restaruant example. When you asked the waiter to
        swap the protein for a vegan friendly tofu the following actions can be
        defined as JavaScript. Initially the waiter would start a function
        called listenToCustomer(). Within the function, it may take what the
        customer asks for and put it through a conditional statement, for
        example, is it possible?
      </p>

      <p>
        Javascript has effectively two conditional structure. There is the "if"
        and "switch" structure. The if structure has several syntax that can be
        used in conjunction with the if statement. This inlcudes the
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">if(condition)</span> if the condition yields
        true, the program does something
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">if(condition) else....</span> This is basically
        the same as the if statement but with a distinct action when the
        condition is not met.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">if(condition) else if (condition) </span> This
        is a combination of the two above where the else will only execute if
        another condition is met.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        These if statements can be nested ontop of each other however if there
        is many conditions, you could also use another conditional structure
        called <span class="bold-style">'switch' </span>. The switch statement
        is evaluated once and the result of the statement is compared to the
        values of each value. If there is a match, the program will excute the
        code within the associated block of code.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>JavaScript also has several loop structures. Some are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>for statment</li>
        <li>do....while statement</li>
        <li>while statement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The loop structures are used to repeat actions that are completed over
        and over again. In our example, our waiter may be running a loop to
        checkon all customers before returning to the kitchen. He might iterate
        (visit) all the table on the restaruant floor.
      </p>
      <!-- FUNCTIONS -->
      <h2>How does a function fit into this?</h2>
      <p>
        Well a function is a set of actions that you might need to do again. The
        actions are package in a function so the programmer does not have to
        rewrite the code everytime he needs it. In our example, the waiter
        checking up on the tables is the function and within the function is
        where the conditional and loop statements may live.
