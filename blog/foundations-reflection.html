      <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        A small blog to reflect on the human skills component of foundations
      </p>

      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I've discovered I'm actually pretty good at connecting with teammates
        when I just focus on really listening to them instead of planning what
        I'll say next. It's been a game-changer for how I work with others. I
        also realized my ego isn't all bad—turns out those high standards I set
        for myself can actually push me to do better when I stop beating myself
        up and start seeing challenges as chances to grow. The biggest surprise
        was finding out that being honest about when I'm struggling doesn't make
        me look weak—it actually helps build trust. When I admitted I was
        completely lost during the tic-tac-toe challenge, I felt supported
        knowing I was not alone.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values provide a foundation for ethical decision-making in programming,
        helping us create software that serves people well rather than just
        meeting technical requirements. Empathy enables us to understand user
        needs deeply and collaborate effectively in teams. Self-awareness helps
        us recognize our strengths and weaknesses, manage stress during
        difficult debugging sessions, and maintain a growth mindset when
        learning complex concepts. Together, these human skills enhance our
        technical abilities by improving how we approach problems and work with
        others.
      </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>
        The most surprising aspect has been discovering how directly applicable
        these "soft skills" are to technical work. I initially expected them to
        be supplementary, but I've found that emotional intelligence and
        communication skills are often what determine a project's success, not
        just technical knowledge. I was also surprised by how much my personal
        biases were influencing my approach to problem-solving without me
        realizing it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>Actually thinking about it deeply</p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The programming school focuses on Human Skills because the tech industry
        has recognized that technical skills alone don't create successful
        developers. The majority of programming work happens in teams and
        involves understanding client needs, communicating complex ideas
        clearly, resolving conflicts, and collaborating on code. Additionally,
        as developers, we're building products for humans, so understanding
        human psychology and needs is essential for creating intuitive,
        accessible, and valuable software. These skills also prepare us for
        technical interviews and workplace interactions that often determine
        career advancement.

      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        No, the time spent on Human Skills doesn't feel wasted at all. While
        more programming practice would have improved my technical skills
        incrementally, the Human Skills learning has multiplied the
        effectiveness of my technical skills. Understanding how to communicate
        my ideas, collaborate with diverse teammates, manage my emotions during
        stressful debugging sessions, and approach problems with creativity has
        made me more effective at applying my technical knowledge. I've noticed
        that I learn programming concepts faster now because I'm more self-aware
        about my learning process and better at asking for help. In the long
        run, these skills will likely be the differentiator in my career
        advancement, as most developers eventually reach similar technical
        competence, but not all develop these crucial human capabilities.
