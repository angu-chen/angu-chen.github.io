      <h2>Career Pathway</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to become a well rounded software developer, using my
        expertise working in areas that I am passionate about and helps makes
        the world a better place. An example could be helping with technology
        for sustainability.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">Honesty</span> -I always try my best to speak
        the truth and present myself in a genuine way. Normally what you see is
        what you get and part of that is I also always try to be honest with
        myself. This may take the form of acknowledging how I am feeling etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">Integrity</span> - I take pride in my work but
        there is a caveat, I try my best to not let my ego get involved. This
        manifest itself as not taking constructive comments personally and not
        being stuck to my ideas etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">Love of Learning</span> - I love learning but
        my relationship with it is sometimes a bit conflicting. I say this
        because the flip side is sometimes I get quite frustrated not knowing,
        but I guess you could argue not knowing allows for space to learn. All
        very philosophical, but the point is, I secretly love the challenge and
        the process of getting better at what I am doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">Team Player</span>I like to think of myself as
        a true team player. I prefer working in a team. Not only do I get more
        done but I also find it more motivating when I am depended on. I love
        the ability to talk over things and building relationships with
        teammates.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="bold-style">Limitations</span>
        - Sometimes I get overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by the sheer size of a
        project or but the copious amounts of information available. Another
        limitation for me is the ability to stay focused for long periods of
        time. Normally I work in 1 hour intervals with 5 minute breaks. This is
        normally quite flexible based on what level of involvement I am in with
        the task. However I find I am always more focused after a 10minute walk
        or a bit of sunshine.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would like to improve my “Think like a programmer” mentality and be
        able to break large tasks down to more manageable chunks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to improve my ability to stay focus on the task at hand
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to further improve knowing when I need a small break in
        order to be more on task
      </p>
      <p>Get better at establishing and maintaining good work environments</p>

      <h2>My Commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h2>
      <p>
        I will treat everyone with respect and in a courteous manner. This means
        respecting them both as a co-worker as well a person. I will practice
        active listening first and foremost. I think this is a great way to
        approach working in a team. I will try to stay honest with what is
        possible and insure that I take breaks even when the workload is high.
      </p>
      <p>
        When things are building up and are starting to get to me, I will let
        the facilitators and the appropriate people know how I am feeling. I
        will ask for advice and continue to do what I can. I will also
        acknowledge that the work is cyclic and that it will pass if I continue
        to chip away. I will continue to take small breaks and do exercise so my
        well-being to maintained.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will seek help from the facilitation team, and my support network when
        I need help. For technical help, I will follow the guidelines given
        during Foundations by DevAcademy and for emotional support I will seek
        it through my support network i.e. family and friends. However if it
        gets to this, I will ensure that I let the facilitation team know as
        well as the appropriate individuals.
      </p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitation team to treat me and the rest of the cohort
        with empathy and respect regarding our questions and needs. I understand
        that this may not be possible all the time or mistakes might happen.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have no kids however I have a part-time job. I am juggling 20 hour
        work week while completing this course. Combine this commitment with
        essential exercise to maintain my well-being means I may not be able to
        be present 100% outside of the allocated working times. However I am
        extremely flexible and engaged.
