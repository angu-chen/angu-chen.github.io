      <h2>Top Strengths according to Institute on Character</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Kindness</li>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Humour</li>
        <li>Honesty</li>
        <li>Love of Learning</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A strange combination of strengths that I would normally not assign to
        myself. However upon further thinking I guess it makes sense. I do try
        my best to be kind and I put alot of value in the people I love. Maybe
        the humour and honestly is somewhat linked. Love of learning is
        definitely a strength. I just love learning!

      <h2>Big Five Personality traits</h2>
      <img src="/images/big-five.png" alt="big five results" />
      <p>
        Honestly speaking, I didn't even know what half those words mean when I
        first got the results. So I did what any sane modern person would do and
        I googled them. It seems like this is a pretty fancy way of saying I am
        pretty close to smack bang in the middle for most traits. Let me sum
        this up in the language of the common people. It suggest that I am more
        open, kind than the average Joe, however not by much. Am I suprised by
        these results? Not really.
