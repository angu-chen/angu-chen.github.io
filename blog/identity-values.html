      <h2>Top Strengths according to Institute on Character</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Kindness</li>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Humour</li>
        <li>Honesty</li>
        <li>Love of Learning</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A strange combination of strengths that I would normally not assign to
        myself. However upon further thinking I guess it makes sense. I do try
        my best to be kind and I put alot of value in the people I love. Maybe
        the humour and honestly is somewhat linked. Love of learning is
        definitely a strength. I just love learning!

      <h2>Big Five Personality traits</h2>
      <img src="/images/big-five.png" alt="big five results" />
      <p>
        Honestly speaking, I didn't even know what half those words mean when I
        first got the results. So I did what any sane modern person would do and
        I googled them. It seems like this is a pretty fancy way of saying I am
        pretty close to smack bang in the middle for most traits. Let me sum
        this up in the language of the common people. It suggest that I am more
        open, kind than the average Joe, however not by much. Am I suprised by
        these results? Not really.

      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Look, I don’t really like tooting my own horn but for an assignment I
        guess I better start tooting. So there I was diligently working on my
        DevAcademy Foundations work. I am trying to catch up because for one
        reason or another I ended up starting the course late. My partner has
        gone to celebrate her friend finishing her PhD with some drinks after
        work. I get another text later on saying that she was going out for
        dinner as well. Perfect… More time for DevAcademy I thought. I am
        working and working and it hits 10.30pm and I receive another message.
        Can you pick me up? Now at this point, if you are expecting a crazy
        story filled with drama you are sadly wrong. I am pretty chilled and
        none of this really matters, however the ethnical dilemma came when I
        arrived and was asked if I wanted to come in as well because they had
        just set up the karaoke. First things first, I am tone deaf and can not
        sing for my life and second, its late and my brain is fried from a long
        day on the computer. What did I say? I said yes because I knew that
        celebrating a PhD properly is important and it is especially important
        to celebrate with friends. So one might ask was this an ethical
        decision? Well according to Google it is. Here is what the ai said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “An ethical decision is a choice that considers the well-being of others
        and is guided by moral principles”
      </p>
      <p>
        I considered the well being of the friend and the well being of the
        karaoke session and my judgement was guided by my moral principle that
        friends and friendships are incredibly important. I regret nothing and
        will do it again in a heartbeat. I sang Kelly Clarkson “Since you been
        gone” and “Where is the love?” by the Black eyed Peas.
