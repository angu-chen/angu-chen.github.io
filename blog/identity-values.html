      <h2>Top Strengths according to Institute on Character</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Kindness</li>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Humour</li>
        <li>Honesty</li>
        <li>Love of Learning</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A strange combination of strengths that I would normally not assign to
        myself. However upon further thinking I guess it makes sense. I do try
        my best to be kind and I put alot of value in the people I love. Maybe
        the humour and honestly is somewhat linked. Love of learning is
        definitely a strength. I just love learning!

      <h2>Big Five Personality traits</h2>

      <p>
        Honestly speaking, I didn't even know what half those words mean when I
        first got the results. So I did what any sane modern person would do and
        I googled them. It seems like this is a pretty fancy way of saying I am
        pretty close to smack bang in the middle for most traits. Let me sum
        this up in the language of the common people. It suggest that I am more
        open, kind than the average Joe, however not by much. Am I suprised by
        these results? Not really.

      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Look, I don’t really like tooting my own horn but for an assignment I
        guess I better start tooting. So there I was diligently working on my
        DevAcademy Foundations work. I am trying to catch up because for one
        reason or another I ended up starting the course late. My partner has
        gone to celebrate her friend finishing her PhD with some drinks after
        work. I get another text later on saying that she was going out for
        dinner as well. Perfect… More time for DevAcademy I thought. I am
        working and working and it hits 10.30pm and I receive another message.
        Can you pick me up? Now at this point, if you are expecting a crazy
        story filled with drama you are sadly wrong. I am pretty chilled and
        none of this really matters, however the ethnical dilemma came when I
        arrived and was asked if I wanted to come in as well because they had
        just set up the karaoke. First things first, I am tone deaf and can not
        sing for my life and second, its late and my brain is fried from a long
        day on the computer. What did I say? I said yes because I knew that
        celebrating a PhD properly is important and it is especially important
        to celebrate with friends. So one might ask was this an ethical
        decision? Well according to Google it is. Here is what the ai said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “An ethical decision is a choice that considers the well-being of others
        and is guided by moral principles”
      </p>
      <p>
        I considered the well being of the friend and the well being of the
        karaoke session and my judgement was guided by my moral principle that
        friends and friendships are incredibly important. I regret nothing and
        will do it again in a heartbeat. I sang Kelly Clarkson “Since you been
        gone” and “Where is the love?” by the Black eyed Peas.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity
      </h2>
      <p>
        Growing up, my family and my Chinese ethnicity shaped a lot of how I
        thought about myself and how I fitted into the world. It was only in the
        last 5 years that my connection to Aotearoa and growing up here has
        merged into that identity rather than clashing with it. Now I find
        myself aggregating the values from both cultures and taking what I think
        works for me. Examples are a dedication to learning from the Chinese
        side and on the Kiwi side the importance for work life balance. My
        partner also greatly influences my values and my identity. I honestly do
        not know what I would be doing without her. She teaches me soft skills
        like active listening, empathy and content while holding me to higher
        standards than I would myself sometimes.

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest strength is enjoying the process of learning. An example of
        this is before my partner and I left the country to Japan, I spent 1
        year improving my Japanese in my own time. This helped open up new doors
        and experiences that would of been hard to do without a grasp of the
        language. Afterwards, we headed to Italy and I learn some basics of
        Italian in 1 month, I had done some Spanish in university so I had some
        idea of grammar and sentence patterns. I wasn’t great but being able to
        order, ask if there was meat inside things and just thank people
        properly was so rewarding. I think my love for learning will support my
        journey in software development because tech is always changing. I do
        not think I will ever stop learning or know everything and that is fine
        by me.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?

      <p>
        1. I am currently working part time. This means my weeks are split
        between working, DevAcademy and being a human. The problem lies that
        both work and DevAcademy has some level of responsibility to teams and
        co-workers. Being human on the other hand does not. I really need to
        make sure I continue to get some sun, exercise, get fresh air, maintain
        relationships and eat. Without these, my ability to complete anything is
        pretty mediocre. I think it will be a delicate balancing act of
        priorities.

        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with

        other strategies you would try now and why
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was in a multidisciplinary team of engineers and management. We were
        in the initial stage of the project where the product was being scoped
        out. This is just a fancy way of saying that what was required of the
        product was airy. However we had to decide on a specific module that was
        needed to run this product. There was a bit of tension between the
        firmware engineer, lead engineer and management. The tension came from
        lack of understanding of firmware and also the airy product
        requirements. I took it upon myself to truly understand what the
        firmware engineer wanted in laymen terms and relayed that information to
        the rest of the team formally and informally. This meant that everyone
        had all the information when making the decision on what modules to use.
        The strategies I used here was not to demonise the firmware engineer but
        to understand the reasons behind the reasoning. Kind of separate the
        individual from the task and when we discussed it, we spent time looking
        at the facts and requirements and how we could meet them. It proved very
        helpful in moving forward. If I had to do it again, I would of
        challenged the requirements a bit more to understand what was high
        priority and what was low priority. I think this would of better aligned
        the team to what was important when making large decisions.
